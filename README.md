# IntuneScripts
Fork of Greg Nottage Intune Scripts by Fabian Niesen (InfrastrukturHelden.de / InfrastructureHeroes.org)
This is a framework for software packaging and automated upload to Intune. 

I will use this repository to provide additional Software examples. And maybe in future will add some mor functions and features. I have some ideas in mind, I just need to find some time.
Next step is implement the use of Versions and create a SCCM script to use the same sources for SCCM Applications.
